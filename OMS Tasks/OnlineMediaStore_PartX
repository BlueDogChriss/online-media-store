Threads

What this exercise is about

The objective of this exercise is to provide you with a practical

example of how to create and use threads in Java.

In this exercise, you create a Runnable class called MemoryDaemon,

which monitors the memory usage of the OnlineMedia program and

outputs its memory usage as it runs.

A new workspace is used for this exercise, and a partially completed

version of the OnlineMediaStore is imported in the first part of the

exercise.

In Part 2, you create the MemoryDaemon class which tracks the

memory usage of the system, and implements the run() method of

this class so it may be run as a thread.

In Part 3, you update the OnlineMedia class to create a

MemoryDaemon object, and then use the object in the constructor of

the Thread class to create a Thread object. The thread is set as a

daemon thread.

When finished, you run the program.

What you did in this exercise

In this exercise, you built and ran a thread using the built-in threading support of the Java

language. You used the Runnable interface.
