Part II: Classes and objects

What this exercise is about

The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate how you can use

Eclipse or Rational Application Developer to implement the

OnlineMedia store, a system for creating orders of compact discs

(CDs), digital video discs (DVDs), and books.

In this exercise, you add some DVDs to an Order (think of it as an

electronic shopping cart). The information about each DVD, such as its

title, cost, and so on, is stored in an external file, called

media.properties. 

Naturally, you create this OnlineMedia store using Java classes,

methods, and so on.

Here are the details of the classes that get built in the exercise:

You first create the OnlineMedia class, which provides a main()

method that interacts with the rest of the system. Then you create the

DigitalVideoDisc class, storing the title, category, cost, director, and

length for each. You also create the Order class to maintain an array of

these DigitalVideoDisc objects.
The DataFromProperties class is used to set and retrieve key values

from a properties file. You use a predefined media.properties file to

populate data for digital video discs, compact discs, and books.

You then add code to the main() method in the OnlineMedia class to

create an Order. Then you create several DVDs, and then populate

the Order with these DVDs. The DVD titles and other information are

stored in a properties file, which is imported into the OnlineMediaStore

project.


What you did in this exercise

In this exercise, you learned how to create and modify Java classes within the Eclipse or

Rational Application Developer workbench. You added getters and setters, modified

variables, and created a main() method. You also created the Java syntax for creating

and using arrays. Finally, you ran your class as a Java application.
