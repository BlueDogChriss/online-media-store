Part IX: Serialization

What this exercise is about

The objective of this exercise is for you to save and restore serialized

objects in Java.

In this exercise, you add the capability of serializing Order objects by

having the Order class and the Media hierarchy implement the

java.io.Serializable interface. In addition, you introduce a new

class called OrderSaver, which is responsible for reading and writing

orders to disk.

A new workspace is used for this exercise, and a partially completed

version of the OnlineMediaStore project is imported in the first part of

the exercise.

In Part 2, you make the Order class, Track class, and Media

subclasses serializable by declaring that they implement the

Serializable interface.

In Part 3, you create a class called OrderSaver to serialize and

deserialize Order objects. OrderSaver contains two static methods,

saveOrder() and restoreOrder(), which serialize and deserialize

Order objects.

In Part 4, the OnlineMedia class is updated to serialize an Order

object. You then create an Order object, initializing it by deserializing

the serialized Order. Finally, the class is run.

What you did in this exercise

In this exercise, you serialized and deserialized a Java class to the file system.
