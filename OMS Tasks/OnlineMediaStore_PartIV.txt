What this exercise is about

The objective of this exercise is for you to use collections in Java as

well as generic type checking provided by the Java compiler.

In this exercise, you begin by extending the OnlineMediaStore system

to allow the ordering of CDs. As with DigitalVideoDisk and Book,

the CompactDisc class extends Media, inheriting the title,

category, and cost fields and the associated methods. In addition, it

stores a String field, artist, and an ArrayList of Tracks called

tracks. The Track class has a title and a length.

A new workspace is used for this exercise, and a partially completed

version of the OnlineMediaStore is imported in the first part of the

exercise.

In Part 2, you create a class, Track, which models the track of a

compact disc; fields are added to this class to store appropriate

information.

In Part 3, you create a CompactDisc class, which is a subclass of

Media and models a real-life compact disc. You also add fields to this

class to store information relevant to a compact disc, including an

ArrayList of Track objects to store the tracks of a compact disc.

In Part 4, you add two methods to the DataFromProperties class which

return a CompactDisc and a Track.
In Part 5, you update the OnlineMedia class to create some Track

objects, add them to a CompactDisc, and then add the CompactDisc

to the Order. The program is then executed.

What you did in this exercise

In this exercise, you learned about collections (java.util.ArrayList) in Java and how to use

generics when instantiating or declaring objects.
