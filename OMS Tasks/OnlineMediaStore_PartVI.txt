Interfaces and sorting

In Part 5, you implement the Comparable interface on Track, and then

test the compareTo() method. When finished, you run the program.

What you did in this exercise

In this exercise you learned about interfaces in Java and how to use them, specifically the

Comparable interface to sort objects within a collection.

Optional exercise

Suppose you want to sort your Tracks by length, rather than title. What changes would

you need to make to your code to do accomplish it?

Try making the necessary changes to the compareTo() method so that your tracks are

sorted by length, from lowest to highest length.

Hint: The return value of the compareTo() method must look something like:

return Float.compare(...)
