Part V: Interfaces

What this exercise is about

The objective of this exercise is to give you practical experience in

using interfaces in Java.

In this exercise, you create an interface called Playable with a single

method, play() and have the CompactDisc, DigitalVideoDisc, and

Track classes implement this interface.

A new workspace is used for this exercise, and a partially completed

version of the OnlineMediaStore is imported in the first part of the

exercise.

In Part 2, an interface called Playable is created, which specifies that a

play() method must be implemented by any class that implements this

interface.

In Part 3, you update the CompactDisc, DigitalVideoDisc and Track

objects to implement the Playable interface, and implement a play()

method in each class.

In Part 4, the OnlineMedia class is updated to invoke the play()

method on DigitalVideoDisc and CompactDisc objects before they are

added to the Order
